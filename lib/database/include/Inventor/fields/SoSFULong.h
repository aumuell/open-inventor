Error. SoSFULong invalid with -DIV_STRICT.  See <Inventor/fields/SoSFULong.h>
------
Inventor now provides So*Int32 types in place of So*Long types to simplify
porting to other architectures and operating systems.  

You should use SoSFUInt32 in place of SoSFULong and also change longs in your
code to the appropriate sized typedef from <inttypes.h>.   The perl script  
/usr/sbin/longToInt32  can assist you making this transition.  Note that not 
all longs should be changed as some are determined by other system include 
files.
