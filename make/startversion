# Startversion target - generate version number (and alpha number) in a 
#			standard fashion

# Input 
#	- TOOLROOT macro is set to point to tools to use for this build.
#	- mkversionnum and showversionnum available in $(TOOLROOT). These 
#		are part of the buildtools ism
#	- include $(IVDEPTH)/make/releasedefs at the same level you 
#		include this file. This provides the definition of the 
#		TREE_ID and RELEASE_NUM macros
#	- The WORKAREA environment variable pointing to a writable directory.
#		Typically, this is a ptools workarea containing one or more 
#		ISMs. The version number generated applies to all of these
#		ISMs.
#	- set the following macros as needed
#	BUILDER - (to 1 if project build, to 2 if build group build) 
#		defaults to 0 (developer build).
#	TREE_ID - to an integer 1-9 to distinguish parallel OS efforts
#		  targeted to new hardware.
#		  It will default to the value of TREE_ID found in 
#		  $(IVDEPTH)/make/releasedefs.
#	PATCH_RELEASE - if creating a patch release (will default to first eight
#		  digits of $(WORKAREA)/.version_number)
#	PATCH_NUM - patch number (sequences patch releases)
#	VNUM_OVERRIDE - a ten digit version number to be directly used.
#		This option is provided as a hook and should rarely if ever be
#		used.

# Output 
#	- $(WORKAREA)/.version_number - the ten digit version number
#	- $(WORKAREA)/.alpha_number - the alpha number portion of the 
#		version number

# Algorithm
#
#	If PATCH_NUM is set then a patch release version number is generated.
#	Else if VNUM_OVERRIDE is set then it will be used as the version number.
#	Else a regular version number is generated.
#
#	Patch version number
#
#		first eight digit are PATCH_RELEASE if it is set.
#		Else first eight digits of $(WORKAREA)/.version_number.
#		It is and error for both PATCH_RELEASE and 
#		$(WORKAREA)/.version_number to be unset.
#
#		last two digits are 30 + (PATCH_NUM mod 70).
#		first eight digits generated above are (potentially)
#		modified by adding PATCH_NUM/70 (this should rarely happen).
#
#	Regular version number
#
#		first three digits are RELEASE_NUM.
#
#		next five digits are the number of hours since 
#		January 1, 1993 and are generated by the mkversionnum 
#		command.
#
#		next digit is BUILDER.
#
#		last digit is TREE_ID.
#
#	Alpha number 
#		is the fourth thru eighth digits from the version number 
#		generated by the above steps. These five digits are the alpha
#		number portion of the version number and are the number of 
#		hours since Jan 1, 1993.

#	The file where the .o file with the ident string lives.
#	Build this into all files, by building with RLS_ID_OBJECT=${V_IDENTFILE}
#	in the environment.  The cc driver automatically passes this to ld
##	if set, as the last item on the ld line.  No problem for standalone
#	because all standalone (coff) programs use ld rather than the driver.
#	variable constructed so the 3.18 (late alpha) ld recognizes the file
#	as "PIC-neutral", so it can be used with shared and -non_shared 
#	binaries. Written so both ident and what show a meaningful string on 
#	all resulting binaries.
#	This one definitely uses the TOOLROOT compiler; do not use $(CCF)
#	because this may be included in Makefiles that do not define it.
