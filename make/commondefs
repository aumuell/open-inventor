# Common makefile definitions.
#
# Notes:
#   - Definitions with the same names only need to be passed on the
#     command line of recursive makes if they would be redefined by
#     the sub-makefile.  Definitions passed on the command line are
#     not reset by the environment or the definitions in the makefile.
#   - C++ style macros are deprecated and will be removed when out of use.
#     They must be interwoven in definitions to keep upward compatibility.
#
#   - The contents of this header are changed based on some variables
#     should be defined BEFORE including this file:
#     OBJECT_STYLE - define basic ABI/ISA that should be used to create product.
#	this also sets LD search paths, C/C++/Fortran/Pascal options.
#     NO_OBJECT_STYLE - disable all this new OBJECT_STYLE business.
#	Note that if one does this all the info in releasedefs about
#	compiler versions, default compilation modes etc will be ignored.
#	Only smake-files can do this.
#     NO_LSRCH - do not set any library searching rules for LD options.
#     ASTYLE  - by default, the ABI/ISA for C is used for assembler -
#	setting ASTYLE (to be assembler options) can override the OBJECT_STYLE
#	to permit fine-tuning of asm code.
#     NO_STARTOPT - don't set any of the DSO start option macros - this
#	will keep the global so_locations files from being updated.

# The $(LWOFF) allows makefiles to set local warnings to ignore
# (note that a leading ',' with no whitespace is required).
#
# Criteria for adding a global woff:
#	a) it in no way could indicate a potential bug in the software.
#		This assumes that the software is required only to run on
#		SGI equipment with SGI compilers.
#	b) The infraction is ubiquitous. If only a few pieces of software
#		suffer from a given warning - they should turn it off in
#		their own Makefile (or fix it!).
#
# The ignored 3.XX compiler warnings are as followings:
#
#	515 - Constant is out of range and may be truncated
#	608 - Undefined the ANSI standard library defined macro <macro>
#	658 - bit-field <name> type required to be int, unsigned int,
#	      or signed int
#	799 - <keyword/type> is not standard ANSI
#	803 - Ignored invalid warning number(s) in -woff option
#	852 - can be const qualified (-wlint)
#
# The ignored 4.XX compiler warnings are as follows:
#	1048 - cast between pointer-to-object and pointer-to-function
#	1233 - explicit type is missing ("int" assumed)
#	1499 - -woff arguments must be in the range ...
#	1685 - The v6.02 compiler changes woff #1499 to 1685.
#	       The specific error is "invalid error number <warning number>"
